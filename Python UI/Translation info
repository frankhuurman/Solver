When a color becomes the front face (faces you) all the other faces change color too.
Included below is a list that is to be used when creating whatever code it is that will be used for translating.

<<<<<-------------------- IMPORTANT ------------------------>>>>>
	
	Ok so, while sides may be changed and what not the actual array behind it needs to remian the same. 
	For example when red is the front(see Red Front for context) then cube.faces[cube.facenames[0]].squares[0][0]: 
	will be in the bottom left rather than in the top left (Which is cube.faces[cube.facenames[0]].squares[0][2]: instead)
	First letter is the turn assuming the default, the second is the equivelant turn assuming the above mentioned color is considered the front.
	Algo2 uses the position of the white part of the edge 
	Algo5 and algo7 use the same translations.
